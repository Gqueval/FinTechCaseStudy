## Recommendations for Robinhood:
### Suggestions:
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
*I would suggest Robinhood to offer different types of accounts, such as Traditional IRA's and Roth IRA's.*

### Why:
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
*I would suggest Robinhood to offer different types of accounts, such as Traditional IRA's and Roth IRA's, not only for stocks but also for cryptocurrency assets as well so there are more tax advantaged options.*
### What Would Be Needed:
* A closer look at Robinhood's competitors, such as TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Vanguard, and M1 Finance is needed as these competitors offer different types of accounts to trade in, such as Tradtional and Roth IRA's, as mentioned previously.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* Different types of accounts being offered is appropriate because Robinhood can continue to educate the masses on investing as they have by providing access to stock and cryptocurrencies, and offering tax advataged accounts.
